    <p>
      Living Word Memphis is more than a church — it’s a movement. Since our founding in 2010, we have been on a bold, Spirit-led journey to see lives transformed, families restored, and communities revived. We exist to glorify God and to demonstrate His Kingdom here on earth through tangible expressions of faith, love, and power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our mission is simple but profound: Love God. Love People. Live in Dominion. This isn't just a motto — it's the heartbeat of our house. From powerful Sunday worship to vibrant midweek encounters, from grassroots outreach to global vision, everything we do flows from this call to live with spiritual authority, compassion, and purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Led by Apostle Derek Talbird, Living Word Memphis is rooted in biblical truth and ignited by the Holy Spirit. We are a prophetic, apostolic church where miracles, healing, deliverance, and dynamic teaching come together to create an atmosphere of breakthrough. Whether you are new to the faith, searching for a deeper relationship with Jesus, or looking to be equipped for Kingdom impact — there is a place for you here.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that church is not just a place to attend, but a people to belong to. At Living Word Memphis, you'll find a culture of honor, a community of faith, and a commitment to discipleship. Join us as we build strong families, raise up Kingdom leaders, and carry revival to Memphis and beyond.

        <h3>Our Beliefs</h3>
        <p>
          Living Word Memphis is built upon the unshakable foundation of the Bible — God’s living, authoritative Word. We believe in one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We believe Jesus Christ is the only way to salvation, and through His death and resurrection, we are redeemed and reconciled to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit, the gifts of the Spirit, divine healing, and the power of prayer. We believe in equipping believers to live victoriously and demonstrate the Kingdom of God in every sphere of life — in homes, schools, businesses, and communities. Our doctrine is rooted in sound theology, shaped by prophetic revelation, and activated through a lifestyle of holiness and surrender.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an apostolic and prophetic church, we stand firm on biblical truth while advancing with a bold vision for revival, reformation, and global impact.
